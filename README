# REALLY UGLY scripts to build a cross-compiler toolchain for the 
# mc68hc11 series with xgate for FreeEMS.
# 
# This runs under linux (x86) and builds a Win32 toolchain including:
#	binutils (both 68hc11 adn xgate cores)
#	gcc 3.3.6 (68hc11 only)
#	newlib
#
#
# This reauires the following packages and maybe more
# autoconf automake dpkg-source texinfo mingw32-runtime mingw32 
# mingw32-binutils build-essential autoconf automake
#
# A minor edit is required to:
# /usr/i586-mingw32msvc/include/stdint.h on line75 to make Gcc compile
# REPLACE ->  typedef unsigned int uintptr_t;
# WITH    ->  typedef int uintptr_t;
#
# the script make_win32_toolchain assumes a destination path of "/target2"
# please modify it to taste...
