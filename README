# REALLY UGLY scripts to build a cross-compiler toolchain for the 
# mc68hc11 series with xgate for FreeEMS.
# 
# This runs under linux (x86) and builds a Win32 toolchain including:
#	binutils (both 68hc11 adn xgate cores)
#	gcc 3.3.6 (68hc11 and 68hc12 cores only)
#	newlib
#	Tools for compiling under windows
#
#
# This reauires the MingW-W64 compilers to already be installed
# in /opt/mingw32 (32 bit target) and /opt/mingw64 (64 bit target)
#
# See http://www.blogcompiler.com/2010/07/11/compile-for-windows-on-linux/
#
# Versions used are :
# mingw-w64-bin_x86_64-linux_20131227.tar.bz2 (64 bit target)
# mingw-w32-bin_x86_64-linux_20131227.tar.bz2 (32 bit target)
